# PiglinKiller
A minecraft plugin for 1.16.2 spigot server designed to kill piglins.

# How to use?
Do /kp to kill all piglins (in the player's current world).
Servers (console users) cannot use this command.

# NOTE:
This plugin does not affect piglin brutes and zombified piglins.

# The folder "ma.saj.piglinkiller" is the project folder from the Eclipse IDE working directory.

# Code is open and free for everyone!

# I used code from this plugin:
https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/killallmobs

# I used this java decompiler (JD-GUI):
